<h1>Beginning</h1>
<p>05.01.2008 little Ergün was born Dad and Mother beside him. I can't tell you much about this time period. <br>Because I don't remember anything lol. But yeah it was the Beginning of something special. <br>My Parents told me I was a very curious boy I would always ask: "What's this?" I annoyed my Parents. <br> I was lucky because everyone was un my life: Aunts, Grandparents, Uncles and Parents I couldn't ask for <br>more! I was a foolish child and very clumsy too hehe. I would stuff and hurt myself. But I was actually reallyy <br> smart. I learned to speak within my first year and after that I could go to the toilett myself Peacefull. But then <br> School came out of nowhere at first I loved it. But that wouldn't be for long unfortunately.
My Teacher didn't like me. <br> I don't know but I think it was racism. A year later my Teacher changed and this one actually liked me she was sweet. <br>let's skip one more year. I'm not quite sure but this was the year where 3 new classmates came in 2 girls 1 boy. I won't <br>tell you their names tho (privacy). The boy and I became best friends we had a group with 4 people in it including me. <br>But the group didn't have a good influence on me or anyone. The strongest one in the group would fight a lot (Street fights) <br>steal and do other mischieves. We were still friends and loved eachother. now comes final year of Volksschule. The strongest <br>had some kind of problem with me I can't remember but we fell apart the 3rd one joined him but my bff stayed with me but not for <br>long. After some time he betrayed me luckily I had two other friends wich whom i'm still friends I love you guys. Both were clean <br> and a way better influence. The strong tried to have beef with me but I don't like trouble so I ignored him. I was getting called names <br>things like that don't bother me. But one of the new girls is gonna get a lot more important this was only the beginning! </p>

    <h1>A new Start</h1>
    <p>1st year of middleschool a brand new Start. I got into the school I want. First day and I already don't like my Klassenvorstand Teacher lol. <br> I don't have any friends and my classmates were not cool on the first glance lol. I focused myself on my studies. Yeah didn't last that long haha. <br> but then someone approached me and the first question was: "Hey, do you play Fortnite?" I know funny as fuck. That was the start of a new friend group. <br>
    Consisting of approximately 7 people and with one I already clicked Tobias. Tobias was unique on my first day I hated him because he was disrespectful. <br>He and I became best friends with one extra addition. The first semester comes to an end and a new Student joins our class of course I had a doctors appointment on that day. <br> His name is Lucas. Lucas is also unique he has good grades but no common sense basically a dumbass. But we clicked thorough Sports. I started Basketball in Volksschule and Lucas played soccer/Football <br> He switched to Basketball and slowly the whole Friend group started playing Bball. Sports era this is where things get interesting. I breathed and lived Basketball it was unhealthy how much I played, <br> and I was the best in the group. Confidence at an all time high. But it came crashing down on me. I started dating a girl. I loved her but she never loved me. She cheated on me I was heartbroken. <br> Me and a friend argued over the Shooting Guard postion for an upcoming tournament. We played for it and I lost badly. I had to switch to Small foward which broke me even more. <br> Me and Lucas would always do a 1V1 tournament to see who the best player out of the group is. I was always the best with Lucas at 2nd place. I lost that too and it broke me more. <br> as if that wasn't enough I get injured sprained ankle it healed quick but it repeated it self. The tournament we lost in the playoffs and I didn't score one point. I was beyond devasteted. <br> before the Tournament in February I started my second relationship with the girl from Volksschule I loved her she loved me too. She made me feel loved but one day in April she left me. <br> My heart was gone and after that we lost the tournament that was the last straw. I started hating myself. At the end of May it was time for the small Tournament. We won of course but it meant nothing. <br> It was a small Tournament. After all if that I didn't play Basketball serious. I lost most of my skill and Jumping Power. I was so afraid of an Injury I fought a lot with Lucas. And I regret everything. <br> It's time to apply to new schools but my grades were utter dogshit. HTL didn't accept me no school did and that's how middleschool ends. The next chapter is the final part.</p>

    <h1>Present</h1>
    <p>The present this is a time period from June 2023 to April 2024. I changed plans I want to work make a lehre. I only had 2 months time of course I didn't make it. <br> Ams had other plans. They sent me to a course "Jugendwerkstatt" I don't to go into detail. I went to IT there I met an amazing man. A little backgrounf <br> I know a lot about IT pcs and other electronics are my field. I code and I love learning about Computer not gonna lie i'm damn good at it. <br> The man gave me hope and so much wisdom. What I know about IT today I learned from him. He's helping me finding a job truly a great person. <br> In august I had a breakdown nobody knows it I cried so much (I never cry) the last time I cried was when I was 9 but I missed that girl so much. <br> And I knew I was a failure because I was Jobless. I'm still in contact with the man we love to hang out. But my depression is still here. <br> My ex added me on snap in November 2023 We chatted a bit and are still talking. I wrote so many letters to companies but all of them <br> got rejected except for Two. We finally had some hope. I passed the Test at one company and the interview at the other one. I was over the Moon <br> But nothing goes well. After the Interview at the 1st company I get an E-Mail that they chose someone else. The other company didn't like my Test. <br> I lost my chances again FUCK ME I'M SO PATHETIC. I was devasteted but I couldn't cry, my sadness turned into anger and I lashed out on myself. <br> I hate myself deeply. everone keeps telling me everythings gonna be alright but now I give up I don't care. I can't tell her how I feel. My family is upset. <br>
    I can't do this anymore. I'm so wothless. I don't even eant to exist anymore. I'm so depressed I don't even hang out with friends. Thanks for reading. </p>
